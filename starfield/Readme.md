#Intro
A p5.js project which simulates a starfield. It moves the frame of reference when mouse is held and moved, and it speeds-up/slows-down the experience if you move the mouse sideways

Potential application would be to build a physical simulator (star cruiser?)
  - use an arduino with a simple potentiometer to speedup/slowdown using a forward/backward lever 
  - use a steering mechanism to move the frame of reference
  - add some more interesting Celestial objects at Random using P3D

#Run
Run the node application
