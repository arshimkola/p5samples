#Intro
A p5.js project which 'simulates' a system with 2 DOF following an object on a 2 dimensional plane. This is essentially computing 'angles' for 2 connected arms so as to follow an object at location x,y. Usually done by solving inverse kinematics equations

Potential application is build a mechanical drawing appartus that reades coordinate data from images and translates it into angles for a double jointed arm (2 servos)
